Still up at https://modthesims.info/d/679929/the-sims-3-british-english-game-localisation-v1-2-1-update.html, but I take **no** chances considering it had two "Changes Requested" and one delisting before it was finally approved there.
# Original description
As story goes, I browsed through recent Sims 3 uploads on Mod The Sims, and noticed the pretty good stuff that is [Fall → Autumn (English)](https://modthesims.info/d/679226/fall-autumn-english.html) by swiffy. So I figured that if she had cracked the code to modify Maxis translation strings, then surely I could do the same, and to even do mass edits in Sublime Text and export it to a .package file.<br>
<br>
How hard could it be? Turned out to be fairly difficult, but I eventually figured it out thanks to NRaas Packer and very immense RegEx skills. I worked on this over the course of 5 days, and am now ready to present to you all the initial late-beta version of the localisation.<br>
<br>
As such, I officially present, a British English fan localisation of The Sims 3 and its expansion packs, the first such localisation to my current knowledge.<br>
<br>
Around 2,400 strings of the circa 85,000 US Maxis base game strings (and a 3-digit number of EP strings) have been changed, so it's not an overwhelming change compared to the official American English version.<br>
<br>
From how I understand override mods, this mod can safely be considered base game compatible, yet also affects many expansion packs if they're installed.<br>
<br>

• 5th City Court of Decisions → SimCity Court of Appeals<br>
• Resume (for jobs) → CV<br>
• Crepes → Crêpes<br>
• Some dialogues in Ambitions investigator missions were in *very* bad taste nowadays due to them resembling real-life conspiracy theories about COVID and the 2020 United States elections, so some words were changed to distance the missions from them. For instance, "pharmaceutical corporations" → "bribed food reviewers", "postal fraud" → "postal spam fraud", and the Ballot Buffoonery quest added mentions of exit polls.<br>

<br>
———v1.2 onwards———<br>
• Removed changes for Bell Pepper and City Hall.<br>
• Snow Cone / Slush → Sorbet<br>
• Game Record (Athletics career) → Match Stats<br>
• "Every professional athlete knows that it's not just about skill; it's about winning, baby! Keep winning games by preparing properly, getting to work with a good mood, and getting there on time.\n\nRemaining Games in Season: {0.Number}\nSeasonal Record: {1.Number}-{2.Number}\nOverall Record: {3.Number}-{4.Number}" → "Every professional athlete knows that it's not just about skill; it's about winning, baby! Keep winning matches by preparing properly, getting to work with a good mood, and getting there on time.\n\nRemaining Matches in Season: {0.Number}\nSeasonal Record: {1.Number} wins, {2.Number} losses\nOverall Record: {3.Number} wins, {4.Number} losses"<br>
• Cheesesteak → Philly Cheesesteak<br>
<br>
———v1.2.1 onwards———<br>
• Hotfixes for the Athletic career, where "Games" are more consistently changed to "Matches".<br>
• Somewhat more consistent use of "Labour" and "Kilometre".<br>
• Dual measurement units were added to a few lines where it seemed like it'd be relevant.<br>
• Links (food) → Sausages<br>
• Sports Game (videogaming) → Madden NFL<br>
• Racing Game → Burnout Paradise (It can't have been that hard for EA to call it Burnout to begin with)<br>
• FIFA → EA FC (to satirise their whole licence debacle, and because Infantino is doing worse than even Blatter)<br>
<br>
For very detailed info on every one of the 2,900+ changed strings as of v1.1, see https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/general-texts/main/Long%20version%20of%20changes.txt. The list is so long that pasting the text into the description literally broke the BBCode description codebase system, which incorrectly made it look like the description was empty.<br>
<br>
———Notes———<br>
• v1.0 only covered the DeltaBuild0.package strings. As such, some (but far from all) stuff in expansion packs remain untranslated. v1.1 added rudimentary support for the FullBuild files of World Adventures, Ambitions, and Seasons, but this does not affect base game support.<br>
• The Fall season currently remains Fall and not Autumn, as I have such respect for the "Fall → Autumn" mod linked to above (as without it, this mod would not have existed), that I intend people to use both mods as of September 2023. Ironically, 1 text string does currently conflict between the two: *"It’s everyone’s favorite/favourite season: Autumn! Your Sim wants to celebrate the season at the Fall/Autumn Festival."* It is unclear which effects this will have.<br>
• I couldn't figure out how to change the date format for savefiles from MM/DD/YYYY to DD/MM/YYYY.<br>
• Players will need to set their game language to en-US in the registry (or whatever macOS's equivalent is named) for the mod to work.<br>
• I am admittedly not actually from any of the countries whose flags are in the main image, but am in fact from Norway. As such, I admit there's a more or less noticeable continental slant to the British translation, certainly for things like Supermarket and Sky-High.
