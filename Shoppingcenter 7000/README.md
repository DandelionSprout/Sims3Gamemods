I honestly have no idea by now how MTS are going to react to a TBD v1.3, so I'm backing up 1.2.0 vjust in case.
# Original description
The shopping mall of a Sim's dreams. A safely indoor, weatherproof, and centralised point of gravity for whatever a Sim may wish for. Designed to not rely on too many expansion packs other than those needed for shopping, to save town space by making various existing lots feasible to delete, and is also a quick way to add features to neighbourhoods that weren't designed with them in mind (e.g. Riverview, Starlight Shores, etc.).<br>
<br>
Since the previous uploads of malls by others on ModTheSims did not seem to me at a surface glance to rely on rabbitholes, I decided to fill that niche by making a lot that does rely on them.<br>
<br>
The lot is 60x60, but can very quickly be adapted to fit 64x64 by simply extending the outdoor pavements.<br>

———Changelog———<br>
• 2nd of June 2023: v1.2.0, which will be the last major update and which was 6 months in the making. Adds Late Night and Seasons to the recommended installed expansions; Generations is also recommended but is not required for core functionality. Expands the clothes shop and bowling alley, and adds more meal providers, a bar section, a gym, a tanning booth, and various motive-related facilities.<br>
• 12th of March 2023: v1.1.4, which removes or fixes objects that had problems (An exercise bar from Showtime, a juice cup, a sketch table paper in the clothes shop, a toilet that wasn't properly clean, and a whiteboard that had text on it), added a seat for the sketch table, and tested out simultaneous .package/.sims3pack lot uploading.<br>
• 23rd of November 2022: v1.1.2 hotfix, to remove parked NPC cars that were added by accident in v1.1.1.<br>
• 23rd of November 2022: v1.1.1 hotfix, to remove novel/comic duplicates in the comic book shelves.<br>
• 23rd of November 2022: v1.1.0, which added a whole lot of new stuff listed above thanks to new discoveries in rooftop and basement building methods. Changes were also made to staircases, fencing, and benches.<br>
• 10th of November 2022: v1.0.2 hotfix, which aims to give handiness upgrades to bathroom and fashion shop objects, and to add skill, toddler, and fishing books to the comic book store shelves. The lot's objects, placements, and values are unchanged.<br>
• 9th of November 2022: v1.0.1 hotfix, which aims to fill the nectar racks in the nectar store with purchaseable bottles, as I was not previously aware that it was possible to do that. The lot's objects, placements, and values are unchanged.<br>
• July 2022: Release version, retroactively numbered v1.0.0.<br>
<br>
———Notes———<br>
• To increase the usefulness of the lot during early morning hours, I recommend another mod I've made, called [Greatly extend lot opening hours](https://modthesims.info/d/670511/greatly-extend-lot-opening-hours-the-city-that-never-sleeps.html).<br>
• In v1.1, in rare cases that I've tried my best to iron out, depending on how the lot is rotated, one or both of the basement rabbitholes could peek out of the basement and cover the entire bistro area. In the rare case that this hinders placing the lot the way you want it, you can use *moveObjects on* to move the rabbithole half a square forwards or backwards.<br>
• A bug in the game appears to cause novels in comic book shelves to duplicate if the lot is placed, then saved to storage, and then placed again.<br>
• If any Into the Future pedestals sell holo discs, the discs at display are known to make odd crying sounds despite not looking all that sad. This is most audible in 5.1 speaker setups.<br>
• The roofing in v1.1 onwards can cast an odd reflection if there's seawater nearby. This does not affect gameplay.
