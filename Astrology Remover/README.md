People who know me on GitHub, know that I'm [very hostile to astrology](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Sensitive%20lists/AntiAstrologyList.txt), and that I consider it to be a huge tainting against the ideals of atheism, which I can fully admit to on GitHub.<br>
## Original description
Now that time and space have moved well into the 21st century of the Common Era, it is well-established that astrology and zodiacs do not hold any real value in determining things. Sims characters, however, still seem to think that they hold tangible value in dating and relationships. This mod aims to make them grow out of that phase.<br>
<br>
This mod was pretty tricky to test, and I took weeks to do so. Special thanks to the [Disable Hopscotch Wishes](https://modthesims.info/d/614658/disable-hopscotch-wishes.html) mod by computeteen5, as without whose mod .package file I could study, I would never have been able to figure out how to prevent specific wishes without glitches occuring.<br>
<br>
———What the mod does———<br>
• (Confirmed) The "Attractive Sim" prompt will no longer cite "What's your sign?" as the reason.<br>
• (Confirmed) In the "Relationship_0x5da0f93630ce52d4" file, "kMatchingSignsBonus" has been changed from 30 to 0.<br>
• (Confirmed) Removing zodiac sign icons from the Live Mode HUD and from Create-a-Sim, through replacing their .package IMAG images with empty transparent images.<br>
• (All but confirmed) Sims will no longer get wishes to ask other Sims for their signs or to meet a compatible sign.<br>
• (Added in v1.1) Removing the hover notes when hovering the cursor over where the Live Mode HUD zodiac sign used to be.<br>
<br>
———What the mod doesn't do———<br>
• (Doesn't seem to be possible to set in .package files) Removing the zodiac option in Create-a-Sim entirely.<br>
• (Would likely be considered unwanted interference) Removing the "Romantic > Ask sign" interaction, as some players could want to use it to diversify their Sims' flirting actions.<br>
• (Would likely be considered unwanted interference) Preventing Sims from joining the Astrology path of the Astronomer career, incl. "Talk About Astrology Sign" and its related moodlets.<br>
• (Would likely be considered unwanted interference) Removing the horoscope option from Supernatural's moondial.<br>
• (Doesn't seem to be astrology) Reducing the functionalities of the Supernatural gypsy wagon or the Store crystal ball.<br>
<br>
———Changelog———<br>
• 1st of October 2023: Version 1.1, which modifies 25 text strings to remove the names of the signs as well.<br>
• May 2023: Initial v1.0 release.
