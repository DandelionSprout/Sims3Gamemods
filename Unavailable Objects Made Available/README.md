Uploaded here because it was rejected post-upload from https://modthesims.info/d/681216 on fake charges that the 9 screenshots were "too far" away (In reality only 2-ish could even vaguely be considered too far). Did they expect me to upload 140 separate screenshots of each one of all 140 objects? If that was to be the case, are they serious?<br>
<br>
# Original description
There's a lot of objects in Sims 3 that Maxis didn't trust anyone who bought their game to do anything with, but which still remain in the game's code, and which can be made accessible again with relatively simple parameter changes in S3PE OBJD files.<br>
<br>
That's right: [i]No[/i] item cloning, [i]no[/i] custom content, these are the real deal objects that Maxis used when developing the game and its expansion packs.<br>
<br>
This mod makes approximately 136 objects available in one or more of Buy Mode (often in BuyDebug), Build Mode, and/or Edit Town, contingent on the relevant expansion packs and/or one stuff pack being installed. For instance, if only the base game is installed and nothing else, 52 objects would be made available by this mod.<br>
<br>
To avoid massive gamebreakers that would make general gameplay trivially easy, certain items have had their prices changed from §0. Such price changes are marked below.<br>

<br>
———Works with small caveats———<br>
• Janie Point Lighthouse (Incorrectly claims "Hot Tub cannot be placed due to obstruction underneath", but can be placed with MoveObjects. The front entrance flickers quite a bit.)<br>
• Mine Entrance. (Same as above.)<br>
• Teleportation Pad (Only works on residential lots.)<br>
• Snow Maker (The snow vanishes when zooming into it, and it creates an odd shadow a floor above.)<br>
• (WA) Al Simhara wooden shipwreck (Needs MoveObjects to place.)<br>
• (WA) Sultan's Tabernacle (No permanently mounted version exists.)<br>
• (LN) Food truck (If NRaas Traveler is installed, the food truck will vanish after some seconds.)<br>
• (LN) Wall Mailbox (Only works on residential lots; vanishes when placed on a public lot.)<br>
• (G) Imaginary Friend Doll (Adults without the Childish trait, are limited to "Pick Up Doll" and "Carrying Doll". Price set to §850.)<br>
• (ST) Hoi Polloi Event Center (Works as intended, but the shell's perimeter has some empty archs, and the shell façade vanishes when entering Buy Mode on its lot.)<br>
• (ST) The Binder Clips Center.<br>
• (ST) Genie Lamp. (Only works on residential lots. Price set to §9,375.)<br>
• (ITF) Debris Site. (Sim will dig infinitely unless the debris is clicked on to choose a treasure. If it's unset, or the treasure is set to continuous, the Sim will dig indefinitely unless interrupted or has low motives.)<br>
• (ITF) Meteor Magnet. (Must be placed in a Sim's inventory to be able to use it.)<br>
<br>
———Works with major caveats———<br>
• Public Picnic Spot (Active Sims cannot actually use them; only NPCs can.)<br>
• (AMB) City Map. (Halfway stuck in the ground.)<br>
• (S) Igloo. (Results in a horseshoe-shaped ring when placed. If there's snow on the ground, Sims can choose to "Resume Building".)<br>
• (ITF) Hot Springs Bubble Spawner (Refuses to be placed on lots even with MoveObjects, doesn't work in seawater, often lacks visual effects even in freshwater. I'd instead recommend placing the object with NRaas Debug Enabler > Create Object > BubblingSprings,EP11. Some additional values have been tuned to increase the effects and diameter of the bubbles.)<br>
<br>
———Didn't work at all (Therefore not included in the mod)———<br>
• Working stoves on public lots. (No commands showed up when clicking on them.)<br>
• Limousines (Sims didn't seem particularly interested in driving in them, and they're borderline impossible to place in Sim inventories anyway.)<br>
• (WA) Nectar bottle. (Results in a bottle with no quality value. Trying to drink it will reset the Sim.)<br>
• (ST) Box of Danger. (No available interactions, and in fact isn't even clickable.)<br>
• (ST) Box of Mystery. (Same as above.)<br>
• (S) Weather Stone (The actual stone is missing, and it refuses to be placed even with MoveObjects. It can however be spawned with NRaas Debug Enabler > Create Object > WeatherStone,EP8)<br>
• (IP) Resort buildings on regular public lots (Sims were unable to interact with them.)<br>
• (IP) Resort food stands on regular public lots (Despite staff being assigned to the stands, the staff never arrives.)<br>
• (IP) Resort buffet tables on regular public lots. (No known way to make them spawn food.)<br>
• (IP) Resort front desks on regular public lots. (Produces an obscure warning, about that the lot would automatically be changed to Resort if going back to Edit Town without removing the desk.)<br>
• (IP) Pre-placed beach towel. (Turns out that Sims couldn't choose to lay down on pre-placed towels.)<br>
• (ITF) Curious Dew (Results in an empty bottle that does nothing. Placing it on a residential lot will softlock the game.)<br>
• (ITF) ZEPHYR station and train pylons (Merely placing stations and pylons along a path, doesn't seem to make it possible to ride the ZEPHYR from a station.)<br>
<br>
———Notes———<br>
• The mod is known to make the following other mods superfluous:<br>
• • [University Life Group Project Un-hider](https://modthesims.info/d/502707/university-life-group-project-un-hider.html)<br>
• • [FoodTruck Enabled](https://modthesims.info/d/424758/foodtruck-enabled-updated-15-11-10.html)<br>
• • [Unlocked Permanent Tents for Residential and Community Lots](https://modthesims.info/d/600856/unlocked-permanent-tents-for-residential-and-community-lots.html)<br>
• It should be perfectly possible to make various large town decorations (e.g. the Bridgeport docks) available too, but I'm not 100% sure how that would be handled.<br>
• Should there be a demand for it, I can add the NRaas Debug Enabler "Create Object" codes for most or all of the above objects.<br>
• It is expected that the mod's users use "By Function" while in Buy Mode to access most of the objects. I have limited experience with "By Room" mode, so it was hard to tell how room subcategories worked like, and which room category combos that were valid.<br>
• 2 images may seem a bit small, but I feel the main image explains the whole deal with the mod.<br>
• • The main image is a "Best of" of sorts, showing around 2/3rds of the unlocked objects, as it wouldn't be practically possible to place e.g. Hoi Polloi and Binder Clips Center in the same screenshot.
