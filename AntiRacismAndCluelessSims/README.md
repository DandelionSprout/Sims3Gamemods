As of 6 January 2024, severe rash health problems prevent me from writing the entire gamemod description in one go (and certainly not screenshots or a full unabridged changelog) but I'll handle it gradually, as well as upload the actual gamemod to <i>de facto</i> Early Access, at some point in January.<br>

Known filechanges:<br>
• FrankensteinReaction_Sim, MummyReaction_Sim, and GhostReaction_Sim have had "AgeSpeciesValue" changed from "C,T,Y,A,E" to the non-existent value "F", ensuring that such reaction cannot ever happen.
• Sim+BladderFailure_0x252b38f2929d72b0a8 and BuffExhausted+PassOut_0x3cad2a5b7ecfd7cd have had "kDistanceToReact" changed from 10 to 0, because Sims reacting to them would make them run out of rabbitholes (Confirmed for the Vault of Antiquity) just to be scared at it, and then lose track of everything they were doing and proceed to <i>also</i> wet themselves or faint.
