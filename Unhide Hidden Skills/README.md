Still also available on ModTheSims at https://modthesims.info/d/680738/unhide-hidden-skills.html … for now.<br>
# Original description
At the time I originally wrote this (6th of November 2023), I had as many as 7 mods and 1 mod update being WIP, so I decided to take care of the one that would be quickest to complete.<br>
<br>
Have you ever wondered, "When is my Sim ever going to get a level-up notification?", "Does this activity even have a skill?", or "When on earth will I start getting DJ gigs, to the point I wonder if DJ gigs even exist"? In any of those cases, it's your lucky day.<br>
<br>
The mod changes only one file, "Skills" in GameplayData.package. The only changes made in that file, are to remove the `[Hidden]True[/Hidden]` rows from the following sections:<br>
• AirGuitar<br>
• ArcadeMachine<br>
• Ballet<br>
• BallFighting (Water balloon, snowball, and dew fights)<br>
• Bowling<br>
• BroomRiding<br>
• Bubbles (Presumably bubble bars)<br>
• BugEating<br>
• ChildAthletic<br>
• ChildBassGuitar<br>
• ChildDrums<br>
• ChildGardening<br>
• ChildGuitar<br>
• ChildPiano<br>

• Hopscotch (Likely to conflict with the Athletic bar)<br>
• InfluenceNerd (Already covered in detail in cellphone menus)<br>
• InfluenceRebel (Already covered in detail in cellphone menus)<br>

<br>
———Notes———<br>
• I didn't feel confident enough at the time of initial upload to test out `[HiddenWithSkillProgress]True[/HiddenWithSkillProgress]` for e.g. chess.<br>
• The skill UI menu's selection row, which is already pretty crowded if all EPs are installed, are likely going to get even more crowded with this mod.<br>
• To the extent I understand .package files, especially so for GameplayData.package, the mod is base game compatible with no changes needed, even if many of the hidden skills involved are from EPs.<br>
• A select few of the unhidden skills have blank notifications when leveling up (e.g. Horseshoes), but this appears to be the exception rather than the rule.<br>
• At the time I created, tested, and uploaded the mod, I was completely unaware of Hidden Skills Unhidden having been made and published a full 10 years earlier. As of 18th of November 2023, the skills that my mod covers, that their mods don't, are:<br>
• • Ballet<br>
• • ChildAthletic<br>
• • ChildBassGuitar<br>
• • ChildDrums<br>
• • ChildGardening<br>
• • ChildGuitar<br>
• • ChildPiano<br>
• • Scouting<br>
Whereas the skills that their list covers, but which aren't in my mod yet, mostly due to me having big concerns about overlapping skill bars, are:<br>
• • Chess<br>
• • Dominoes<br>
• • FairyMagic<br>
• • Golfing<br>
• • Hopscotch<br>
• • InfluenceNerd<br>
• • InfluenceRebel<br>
• • InfluenceSocialite<br>
• • RockBand
